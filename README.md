hey buddy we need to make a high quality website for food delivery naming QuickBite starting with showing a without face food delivery guy with offering food and the scroll down to browse categories and option to add items to cart and on clicking on add to cart show option to add more than 1 i mean like in centre no. of item add of a particular object on left delete and on right + sign to add more and some tagline in that food delivery guy image like ("Hungry? We've got you Covered!") also when we scroll down that image should become square to rectangle in motion like you can understand also in categories (pizza, burgers, drinks, deserts) and scroll down to get today's offers and scroll down to get menu
lookin good ok lets add everything in upgrade you are telling me but i also want you to add the boxy effect on todays offers and in menu weve added only one option that to without any image so we need to add some images of other items and and more animations to it
ok looking good and yes i wnat to make everything you are telling me but the name plate of quickbite is too long lets shorten that and give options for login and then in menu add then options atleast 20 options toh ho and ui lookin good
the upper red banner shoulb be small &and pehle jab add to cart karte the tab aata tha +- but ab nhi aarha and ye jo image hai isko full kardo orange area mein and jahan likha hai uss jagah blurred effect on the image and when we scroll down the image move to into its original shape and size and animates
